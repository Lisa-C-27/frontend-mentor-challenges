## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Issues I faced

I was having issues trying to position the background images so that I would not need to use media queries as the project suggested that media queries would not be needed. After a lot of trial and error I had personally ended up using media queries when I posted my solution. After a suggestion from another member in the community, they had found a working solution from another member (posted below in the acknowledgements)
